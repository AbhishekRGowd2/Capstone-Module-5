# Capstone-Module-5



MediEase is a patient-centric healthcare management system designed to streamline medical appointments and records. The frontend, built with React.js, allows patients to securely register and log in using JWT authentication. Once authenticated, users can view and update their personal profiles, including contact details and medical information. The core functionality includes an appointment booking system where patients can select departments (such as Cardiology or Dermatology), choose available time slots, and upload relevant medical reports in PDF or image formats. The interface displays confirmation messages upon successful bookings and maintains a history of all appointments, filterable by year for easy reference.**

The system features robust form handling with real-time validation for patient registration, profile updates, and appointment scheduling. Error handling ensures users receive clear feedback when submissions fail. While currently focused on patient-facing features, the architecture supports future expansion to include doctor portals for prescription management and admin panels for user management. The responsive design works across devices, with mobile-friendly layouts that maintain functionality on smaller screens. All medical data remains private and accessible only to authenticated users, with security measures in place to protect sensitive health information.**

Key user flows include: account creation and login, profile management, appointment scheduling with file attachments, and viewing appointment history. The clean, intuitive interface guides patients through each process without unnecessary complexity. Technical implementation includes React hooks for state management, Formik for form handling, and Axios for secure API communications. The project demonstrates practical healthcare digitization while maintaining focus on essential patient needs - easy appointment booking and secure access to personal medical information.
